## Remarks

Mounting the 34 U soundproofed server cabinet is no easy feat when attempted
single-handedly. At least two to three people are advisable for receiving the
freight and affixing it to its casters. Once assembled, I ran into another
issue: the temperature-segmented LCD display is located right at the top of the
unit. This is precisely where networking gear like patch panels and switches
usually go, and the clash makes it difficult to close the cabinet door if there
are multiple ethernet cables. The solution is straightforwardâ€”avoid installing
your networking equipment in U 3 or 4 (counting from the top down).

The cabinet's heat management has its limitations, especially when it's near
capacity. Despite being soundproofed, the heat buildup inside made it impossible
to keep the door closed. I had to improvise by leaving the door open and using a
floor fan to circulate air inside the cabinet. Although this situation isn't the
fault of the manufacturer, it's an important consideration for potential buyers.
On the upside, the built-in temperature fan control works effectively and is a
nice feature of the unit. I plan to further enhance the cooling capabilities
soon by installing an additional two exhaust fans on the top side.
