virtual machines, proxmox cluster, k8s cluster, dns, and more.

## :handshake:&nbsp; Thanks



Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.

And also a big thanks to the great community from the [Self-Hosted Podcast](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/self-hosted/) (and Jupiter Broadcasting in general!). It's a friendly community of FOSS, Linux, Self-Hosting advocates.
